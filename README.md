# 👋 Hey, I'm VOVO

Yes, the username is the same as the repo — GitHub demands it, not me.  
I’m currently learning **Python** (specifically `discord.py`) so I can build Discord bots that are actually useful… or chaotic. Depends on the day.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On
- Crafting Discord bots that behave better than most humans  
- Figuring out Python’s quirks without sacrificing my sanity  
- Slowly preparing to dive into **JavaScript** & **web development**  
- Automating small things that I definitely could do manually, but refuse to

## 🎮 Tech & Tools I Use
- **Python** (discord.py, asyncio, the usual suspects)  
- **Linux servers** (cuz VPS is too expensive)
- **Fusion 360 & Blender** for 3D adventures  
- **DaVinci Resolve** for editing — because of course I needed *one* hobby with GPU usage  
- **Bambu Lab A1 Mini** for turning plastic spaghetti into objects

## 🏗️ Things I Build
- Discord bots that don’t crumble under pressure  
- Random scripts that solve problems I created in the first place

## 📚 Currently Learning
- Python best practices (yes, they exist)  
- Error handling that doesn't involve crying  
- How to write code without future-me filing a restraining order

## 🚀 Goals
- Become comfortable with discord bots
- Build polished web projects (or any at all)  
- Continue leveling up my editing & 3D skills  

## ⚡ Fun Facts (because apparently people like those)
- I enjoy snowboarding, solving Rubik’s cubes, and escaping Blender’s “why did that happen” energy  
- Favorite food: **svíčková**, objectively a top-tier choice  
- I host my own servers because relying on free services is a speedrun to disappointment
