# 👋 Hey, I'm VOVO

Yes, the username is the same as the repo — GitHub demands it, not me.
Currently teaching myself **Python** and `discord.py` so my bots stop breaking every time I look away.  

## 🧠 What I’m Working On
- Bots that might be useful... or not  
- Automation for things I could (and should) absolutely do manually  
- Negotiating peace with Python errors

## 🎮 Tech I Use
- **Python**, **Linux servers** (because VPS pricing is comedy)
- **Visual Studio Code** formerly Cursor 🤖  
- **Fusion 360** & **Blender** for 3D chaos  
- **DaVinci Resolve** for “why is this render taking 4 hours”  
- **Bambu Lab A1 Mini** for turning filament into… shapes

## 🚀 Goals
- Understand Discord bot logic without summoning stacktraces  
- Build at least *one* project I’m proud of  
- Keep leveling up in editing & 3D without losing my sanity

## ⚡ Fun Stuff
- Snowboarding, Rubik’s cubes, and Blender’s physics engine doing black magic  
- Favorite food: **svíčková** (elite pick)  
- Self-hosting servers because I like being dissapointed
